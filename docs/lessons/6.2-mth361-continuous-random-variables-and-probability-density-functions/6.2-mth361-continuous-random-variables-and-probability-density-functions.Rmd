**Random Variables**

A random variable (r.v.) is a function that maps the sample space into real numbers.

**Probability Functions**

A probability function maps the r.v. into the the real numbers between 0 and 1.

There are two types of r.v.s --discrete and continuous-- with corresponding probability functions --probability mass function (PMF) and probability density function (PDF) respectively.

**Geometric R.V.**

\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{R.V. } & \longrightarrow X \sim \text{Geom}(p) \\
\text{PMF } & \longrightarrow P(X=k) = (1-p)^k p \\
\text{for } & k = 0,1,2, \cdots \\
\text{expected value} & \longrightarrow \text{E}(X) = \frac{1-p}{p}
\end{aligned}
\]

**Binomial R.V.**

\[
\begin{aligned}
\text{R.V. } & \longrightarrow X \sim \text{Binom}(p) \\
\text{PMF } & \longrightarrow P(X=k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \\
\text{for } & k = 0,1,2,3, \cdots, n \\

**Geometric R.V. (Revisited)**

- Independent Bernoulli trials with "success" probability $p$
- Count the number of "fail" trials before the first "success"
- The probability of getting $k$ number of "fail" before a "success" follows the Geometric PMF
- The expected number of fails before a "success" is $\frac{1-p}{p}$

$\star$ **Key Idea:** In a time-based interpretation, if events occur in discrete time steps, the geometric r.v. represents the number of time steps required until an event of interest happens.
:::

## Case Study 1

A professor allows students to take a short assessment quiz, and if they do not pass, they can revise their answers and retake the quiz in the next session. The probability that a student passes on any given attempt is $p=0.40$, and attempts continue until the student passes.

Let $X$ be the number of "fail" attempts before the student get a "pass".

:::: {.column width=49%}
**Information Given:**

* R.V. is $X \sim \text{Geom}(p)$
* Expected value is $\text{E}(X) = \frac{1-p}{p}$
* What is the expected number of "fail" until a student get a "pass"? $$\text{E}(X) = \frac{1-0.40}{0.40} = 1.5$$
::::

:::: {.column width=49%}
**Computing Probabilities:**

* Geometric PMF is $P(X=k) = (1-p)^k p$
* What is the probability that a student get a "pass" with at most $1$ "fail" attempt? 
$$
\begin{aligned}
P(X \le 1) & = \sum_{k=0}^1 P(X=k) \\
           & = (0.60)^0 (0.40) + (0.60)^1 (0.40) \\
P(X \le 1) & = 0.64
\end{aligned}
$$

**Using R:**

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
p <- 0.40
pgeom(1,p)
```

::::

::: {style="color: red;"}
This means that, on average, the student would "fail" on their 1st attempt before they get a "pass". The chances of a "pass" with 1 "fail" attempt is $0.64$.
:::

## Rate to "Success" (Continuous)

:::: {.column width=50%}
```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics("rate-to-success-continuous.png")
```
:::

:::: {.column width=49%}
**Exponential R.V.**

- Unit length until an event occurs
- "success" event happens at a constant rate
::::

::: {style="color: red;"}
$\star$ **Key Idea:** In a time-based interpretation, if events occur in continuous time, the exponential r.v. represents the length of time required until an event of interest happens.
:::

## The Exponential R.V.

The **exponential r.v.** is a continuous r.v. that models the time until an event occurs, given that the event happens at a constant rate over time called $\lambda$: $$X \sim \text{Exp}(\lambda)$$

**Sample Space:**

* $x \in [0,\infty)$ because the length of time until an event occurs can be any positive unit length

**Rate Parameter**

* $\lambda$ is reciprocal to the average time of an event occurs.
* This means that --on average-- $\frac{1}{\lambda}$ "success" occurs per unit length.

## The Exponential R.V.: PDF

The exponential r.v. $X \sim \text{Exp}(\lambda)$ has infinite possible outcomes (or infinite sized sample space) where $\lambda > 0$ is the rate of "success" with PDF given as $$f(x) = \lambda e^{-\lambda x}, \ x \ge 0$$

::: {style="color: red;"}
$\star$ **Key Idea:** The exponential r.v. models the unit length until an event happens.
:::

## Probabilities of PDFs

A **Probability Density Function (PDF)** $f(x)$ describes the likelihood of a continuous r.v. taking a specific value.

* The probability of a single point is zero for continuous distributions: $$P(X = x) = 0, \ \text{for any } x$$ because continuous distributions are defined over an infinite number of possible values, and the probability at a single point is infinitesimally small.

* Instead, we calculate probabilities over intervals using integration: 

  - Cumulative $\longrightarrow \displaystyle P(X \le x) = \int_{-\infty}^x f(t) \ dt$
  - Interval $\longrightarrow \displaystyle P(a \le X \le b) = \int_a^b f(t) \ dt$

::: {style="color: red;"}
$\star$ **Key Idea:**

* PMF (discrete r.v.): $P(X=k)$ is a meaningful probability
* PDF (continuous r.v.): $P(X=x)=0$, but density matters for interval probabilities.
:::

## Case Study 2

A class of students is taking a quiz, and the time it takes for students to finish the quiz follows an exponential r.v., assuming unlimited quiz time allocation. On average, a student takes 15 minutes to complete the quiz.

Let $X$ represent the time to finish the quiz.

:::: {.column width=49%}
**Information Given:**

* The time it takes for a student to finish a quiz follows an exponential distribution: $$X \sim \text{Exp}(\lambda)$$ where $\lambda$ is the rate parameter.
* $\lambda = \frac{1}{15}$, which can be interpreted in two ways:
    - on average, one student finishes the quiz in 15 minutes
    - on average, a student finishes $\frac{1}{15}$ part of the quiz per minute
::::

:::: {.column width=50%}
**Computing Probabilities:**

* The exponential PDF is $$f(x) = \frac{1}{15} e^{-\frac{1}{15} x}$$
* What is the probability that a student finishes a quiz less than or equal to 15 minutes?
\[
\begin{aligned}
P(X \le 15) & = \int_0^{15} f(x) \ dx \\
            & = \int_0^{15} \frac{1}{15} e^{-\frac{1}{15} x} \ dx \\
P(X \le 15) & \approx 0.632
\end{aligned}
\]

**Using R:**

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
lambda <- 1/15
pexp(15,lambda)
```

                   y=rep(0,length(x)),yend=binom_pmf), 
                   color="black") +
