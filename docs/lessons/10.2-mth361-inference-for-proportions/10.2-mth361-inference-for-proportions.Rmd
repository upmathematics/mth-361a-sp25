The guiding principle of statistics is statistical thinking.

## Previously... (2/3)

**Types of Inference**

|  | **Parameter Estimation** | **Hypothesis Testing** |
|:---|:------|:------|
| _Goal_ | Estimate an unknown population value | Assess claims about a population value |
| _Methods_ | Point Estimation: A single value estimate (e.g., sample mean) <br>Interval Estimation: A range of plausible values (e.g., confidence interval) | State a null and an alternative hypothesis <br>Compute a test statistic and compare it to a threshold (p-value or critical value) |
| _Key Concept_ | Focuses on precision in estimation (confidence intervals) | Focuses on decision-making based on evidence (reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis) |

**Types of Decision Errors**

| Reality/Decision | **Reject $H_0$**                                                      | **Fail to reject $H_0$**                                                  |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **$H_0$ is true**    | Type I error<br>with probability $\alpha$<br>(significance level) | Correct decision<br>with probability $1-\alpha$<br>(confidence level) |
| **$H_0$ is false**   | Correct decision<br>with probability $1-\beta$<br>(power of test) | Type II error<br>with probability $\beta$                             |

## Activity: Rock-Paper-Scissors Hypothesis Testing

1. Make sure you have a copy of the *W 3/19 Worksheet*. This will be handed out physically and it is also digitally available on Moodle.
2. Work on your worksheet by yourself for 10 minutes. Please read the instructions carefully. Ask questions if anything need clarifications.
3. Get together with another student.
4. Discuss your results.
5. Submit your worksheet on Moodle as a `.pdf` file.
