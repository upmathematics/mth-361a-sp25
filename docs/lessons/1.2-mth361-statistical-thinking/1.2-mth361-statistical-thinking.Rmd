## Statistical Thinking: An Overview

**What is statistical thinking?**

A way of understanding the world through data.

```{r statistical-thinking-1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Statistical Thinking in the Data Science Life Cycle", fig.align='center', out.width = '55%'}
knitr::include_graphics("statistical-thinking-in-data-science-lifecycle.png")
```

## Example 1: Statistical Question

*Question:* **What is the crime rate in Portland, OR?**

This question requires:

  1. Data collection from a representative sample of neighborhoods in Portland.
  2. Statistical analysis to estimate the average crime rate.

## Example 1: Preparation

*Question:* **What is the crime rate in Portland, OR?**

The analysis anticipates:

  1. **Variability.** No two neighborhoods will produce exactly the same result.
  2. **Uncertainty.** Because data varies, we’re often unsure about the "true" answer to the question.
  3. **Context.** Numbers alone don’t tell the whole story. You need to consider the situation, the method of data collection, and any potential biases.

## Example 1: Data Visualization

```{r portland-crime-rates, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Portland crime rates in fiscal year 2020 to 2021.", fig.align='center', out.width = '55%'}
knitr::include_graphics("reported-crimes-per-1000- fy-2020-2021.png")
```

## Example 1: Confounders

*Follow-up question:* **What types of crimes are usually reported?**

```{r portland-types-of-crimes, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Portland types of crimes in year 2020 to 2021.", fig.align='center', out.width = '100%'}

**Steps in Statistical Thinking:** 

  1. Ask a question or identify a problem
  2. Collect data, understand variability, identify patterns and relationships
  3. Apply statistical analysis
  4. Evaluate results and make a conclusion or predict an outcome

## Activity: Reading and Writing Exercises

**Scenario:** Researchers conducted a study to understand whether drinking coffee impacts productivity at work. They collected data on how much coffee people drink daily and how productive they feel during their workday. The study examined whether there is a consistent pattern between coffee consumption and productivity levels.

**Discussion Questions:**

1. What is the main focus of the study?
2. How might coffee consumption affect productivity, based on your intuition?
3. What could a strong relationship between coffee consumption and productivity suggest for coffee drinkers?
4. What other factors (confounders) might influence both coffee consumption and productivity? How could these affect the study's conclusions?
5. If the study finds a meaningful connection, what practical advice could it offer to workers?
