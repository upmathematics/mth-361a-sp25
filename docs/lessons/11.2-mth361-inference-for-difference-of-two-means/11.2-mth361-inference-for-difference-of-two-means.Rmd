## Case Study I: Fuel Efficiency in the City

The problem shown below was taken and slightly modified from your textbook [OpenIntro: Introduction to Modern Statistics Section 20.6](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/inference-two-means.html#chp20-exercises){target="_blank"}. Consider the research study described below.

> Each year the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) releases fuel economy data on cars manufactured in that year. Below are summary statistics on fuel efficiency (in miles/gallon) from random samples of cars with manual and automatic transmissions manufactured in 2021. Do these data provide strong evidence of a difference between the average fuel efficiency of cars with manual and automatic transmissions in terms of their average city mileage? [US DOE EPA 2021](https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/download.shtml){target="_blank"}

We will compute the 95\% confidence interval for the true difference in means $\mu_{automatic} - \mu_{manual}$.

```{r fig.align='center', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
set.seed(1234)
epa2021_sample <- epa2021 %>%
  filter(transmission_desc %in% c("Manual", "Automatic")) %>%
  group_by(transmission_desc) %>%
  sample_n(size = 25)

epa2021_sample %>%
  group_by(transmission_desc) %>%
  summarise(
    Mean = mean(city_mpg),
    SD   = sd(city_mpg),
    n    = n()
  ) %>%
  kbl(linesep = "", booktabs = TRUE, align = "lccc", col.names = c("CITY", "Mean", "SD", "n"), digits = 2) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "condensed"), 
                latex_options = "HOLD_position",
                full_width = FALSE)
```

## Case Study I: Conditions

  * Conditions.
    - **Independence** (extended). The data are independent within and between the two groups, e.g., the data come from independent random samples or from a randomized experiment.
    - **Normality**. We need large enough sample size for each group - at least 30. We check the extreme outliers for each group separately.
    
```{r fig.align='center', fig.width=5, fig.height=3, out.width="60%", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(epa2021_sample, aes(y = fct_rev(transmission_desc), x = city_mpg)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(y = NULL, x = "City mileage (MPG)")
```

Here, we see two outliers in the manual group. However, both groups shows decent distributions with balanced outliers where - in this case - we can "ignore" the outliers and assume normality of the sampling distribution of the means.
    
## Case Study I: The Margin of Error (1/3)
    
  * The **standard error** may be computed as
    $$SE = \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{\sigma_2^2}{n_2}}$$
    The official formula for the degrees of freedom is quite complex and is generally computed using software, so instead you may use the smaller of $n_1 - 1$ and $n_2 - 1$ for the degrees of freedom if software isn't readily available.
    
  * **Margin of error for** $\bar{x}_1 - \bar{x}_2.$
    The margin of error is $t^*_{df} \sqrt{\frac{s_1^2}{n_1} + \frac{s_2^2}{n_2}}$ where $t^*_{df}$ is calculated from a specified percentile on the t-distribution with *df* degrees of freedom.
    
## Case Study I: The Margin of Error (2/3)

  * Standard Error
    \[
    \begin{aligned}
    SE & = \sqrt{\frac{s_{automatic}^2}{n_{automatic}} + \frac{s_{manual}^2}{n_{manual}}} \\
       & = \sqrt{\frac{3.44^2}{25} + \frac{4.58^2}{25}} \\
    SE & = 1.1456
    \end{aligned}
    \]
    
  * Margin of Error
    \[
    \begin{aligned}
    ME & = t^*_{24} SE \\
       & = 2.0639 (1.1456) \\
    ME & = 2.3644
    \end{aligned}
    \]
    
## Case Study I: The Margin of Error (3/3)
  
  * *A note on the degrees of freedom:* Our example shows two equal sample sizes in each group. So, the degrees of freedom is $25 - 1 = 24$. In some cases where the sample sizes are different, normally we can pick the smaller sample size. This doesnâ€™t bias your CI. It just means the power you have is based on the smaller sample.
  
  * We have talked about power when we learned about decision errors but we will talk more on the power concept later.
  
## Case Study I: 95\% Confidence Interval 
  
  * The 95\% Confidence interval is computed as.
  \[
  \begin{aligned}
  \bar{x}_{automatic} - \bar{x}_{manual} \pm ME & = 17.4 - 22.7 \pm 2.3644 \\
                                                & = -5.3 \pm 2.3644
  \end{aligned}
  \]
  $$(-7.6644,-2.9356)$$
    
Therefore, we are 95\% confident that the true difference in mean fuel efficiency (miles/gallon) between automatic and manual cars is between 2.9356 and 7.664 in absolute value. 

Note that the values are originally negative because how the order of difference terms are computed, meaning a negative difference indicate that there is more efficiency in cars with manual transmission than automatic transmission.

## Activity: Determine Confidence Intervals for Difference in Means

1. Make sure you have a copy of the *W 3/26 Worksheet*. This will be handed out physically and it is also digitally available on Moodle.
2. Work on your worksheet by yourself for 10 minutes. Please read the instructions carefully. Ask questions if anything need clarifications.
3. Get together with another student.
4. Discuss your results.
5. Submit your worksheet on Moodle as a `.pdf` file.
