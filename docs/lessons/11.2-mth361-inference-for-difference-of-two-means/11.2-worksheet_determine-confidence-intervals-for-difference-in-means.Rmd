## Determine Confidence Intervals for Difference in Means

### 1. Chicken Diet

An experiment was conducted to measure and compare the effectiveness of various feed supplements on the growth rate of chickens. Newly hatched chicks were randomly allocated into groups, and each group was given a different feed supplement. We consider chicks that were fed horsebean and linseed. Below are some summary statistics from this dataset along with box plots showing the distribution of weights by feed type.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, out.width="50%",fig.align='center', fig.height=3,fig.width=6}
library(patchwork)
chickwts_h_l <- chickwts %>%
  filter(feed %in% c("horsebean", "linseed"))

chickwts_h_l %>%
  group_by(feed) %>%
  summarise(
    mean = format(mean(weight), digits = 2, nsmall = 2),
    sd   = format(sd(weight), digits = 2, nsmall = 2),
    n    = n()
  ) %>%
  kbl(linesep = "", booktabs = TRUE, align = "lccc", 
      col.names = c("Feed type", "Mean", "SD", "n")) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "condensed"), 
                latex_options = "HOLD_position",
                full_width = FALSE) %>%
  column_spec(1:4, width = "6em")

p_box <- chickwts_h_l %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = fct_rev(feed), x = weight)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(y = "Feed type", x = "Weight (in grams)")

p_hist <- chickwts_h_l %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = weight)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 25) +
  facet_wrap(~feed, ncol = 1) +
  labs(y = "Feed type", x = "Weight (in grams)")    

p_box + p_hist
```
