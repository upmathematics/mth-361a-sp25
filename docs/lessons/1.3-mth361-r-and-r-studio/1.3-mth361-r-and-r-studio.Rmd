## How Posit Cloud Works?

```{r posit-cloud-network, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Posit Cloud Computing", fig.align='center', out.width = '75%'}
knitr::include_graphics("how-posit-cloud-works.png")
```

## Basic Parts of Posit Cloud

```{r posit-cloud-1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Basic Parts of Posit Cloud", fig.align='center', out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics("basic-parts-of-posit-cloud.png")
```

## Activity: Setting up Posit Cloud

1. Sign-up for a free [Posit Cloud](https://login.posit.cloud/){target="_blank"} account using your UP email. Then, log-in.
2. Enter your email again using this form - [Email Entry for Activity: Setting up Posit Cloud](https://forms.office.com/r/8Rm8Ni7aDG?origin=lprLink){target="_blank"} so I can add you to the course's workspace. You will be invited to this course's Workspace soon. Check your email.
3. Enter the Workspace using the link in the email sent from Posit Cloud, then click on the assignment named *Calculator [First name][Last initial]*. This will create a copy for you.
4. Rename your copied assignment as *Calculator [First name][Last initial]*.
5. For now you can explore Posit Cloud. We will discuss more about this tool as we progress.
