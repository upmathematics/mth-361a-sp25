**Types of Inference**

|  | **Parameter Estimation** | **Hypothesis Testing** |
|:---|:------|:------|
| _Goal_ | Estimate an unknown population value | Assess claims about a population value |
| _Methods_ | Point Estimation: A single value estimate (e.g., sample mean) <br>Interval Estimation: A range of plausible values (e.g., confidence interval) | State a null and an alternative hypothesis <br>Compute a test statistic and compare it to a threshold (p-value or critical value) |
| _Key Concept_ | Focuses on precision in estimation (confidence intervals) | Focuses on decision-making based on evidence (reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis) |

The **standard normal distribution** is when $\mu=0$ and $s=1$ or $Z \sim \text{N}(0,1)$.

**The transformation formula (the z-score)**

Standardized scores that measure how many standard deviations a value is from the mean. $$Z = \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$$

**The standard normal distribution, $Z \sim \text{N}(0,1)$.**

## Confidence Intervals

A plausible range of values for the population parameter is called a **confidence interval**.

**Analogy**

* Using only a sample statistic to estimate a parameter is like fishing in a murky lake with a spear, and using a confidence interval is like fishing with a net.
* We can throw a spear where we saw a fish but we will probably miss. If we toss a net in that area, we have a good chance of catching the fish.

::: {style="color: red;"}
$\star$ **Key Idea:** If we report a point estimate, we probably won't hit the exact population parameter. If we report a range of plausible values we have a good shot at capturing the parameter.

## Case Study I

**Facebook’s categorization of user interests**

Most commercial websites (e.g. social media platforms, news out- lets, online retailers) collect a data about their users’ behaviors and use these data to deliver targeted content, recommendations, and ads.

To understand whether Americans think their lives line up with how the algorithm-driven classification systems categorizes them, Pew Research asked **a representative sample of 850 American Facebook users** how accurately they feel the list of categories Facebook has listed for them on the page of their supposed interests actually represents them and their interests. **67% of the respondents said that the listed categories were accurate**.

Estimate the true proportion of American Facebook users who think the Facebook categorizes their interests accurately.

## Case Study I: Point Estimate and Standard Error

The goal of parameter estimation is to find a range of possible values (confidence interval).

**Given information**

* $\hat{p} = 0.67 \longleftarrow \text{point estimate}$
* $n = 850 \longleftarrow \text{sample size}$
    - The expected number of users who think the Facebook categorizes their interests accurately is $850 \times 0.67 \approx 569.5$ (569 or 570).
    - There around 280.5 (280 or 281) users think the opposite.
* Let $p$ bet he true population proportion and $\hat{p}$ be the sample proportion.
    
**The Confidence Interval**

We want to find the 95% confidence interval using the formula: $$\text{point estimate} \pm 1.96 \times \text{SE}$$ where **SE is the standard error**.

This can be written as 
\[
\begin{aligned}
0.67 & \pm 1.96 \times \sqrt{\frac{0.67 (1-0.67)}{850}} \\
0.67 & \pm 1.96 \times 0.0161 \\
& \longrightarrow (0.67-0.0316,0.67+0.0316) \\
& \longrightarrow (0.6384,0.7016)
\end{aligned}
\]

Thus, the 95% interval for estimating the true $p$ is between 0.6384 and 0.7016.

## Case Study I: Interpretation

Which of the following is the correct interpretation of this confidence interval? We are 95% confident that:

i. 64% to 67% of American Facebook users in this sample think Facebook categorizes their interests accurately.
ii. 64% to 67% of all American Facebook users think Facebook categorizes their interests accurately
iii. there is a 64% to 67% chance that a randomly chosen American Facebook user’s interests are categorized accurately.
vi. there is a 64% to 67% chance that 95% of American Facebook users’ interests are categorized accurately.

::: {style="color: red;"}
$\star$ 64% to 67% of all American Facebook users think Facebook categorizes their interests accurately.
:::

::: {style="color: blue;"}
$\dagger$ Why do we interpret the confidence interval this way?
:::

## What does 95% Confident Mean?

Suppose we took many samples and built a confidence interval from each sample using the equation $$\text{point estimate} \pm 1.96 \times \text{standard error}.$$

Then about 95% of those intervals would contain the true population proportion ($p$).

## Width of an interval

If we want to be more certain that we capture the population parameter, i.e. increase our confidence level, should we use a wider interval or a smaller interval?

::: {style="color: red;"}
$\star$ A wider interval.
:::

Can you see any drawbacks to using a wider interval?

::: {style="color: red;"}
$\star$ If the interval is too wide it may not be very informative.
:::

## Changing the Confidence Level

$$\text{point estimate} \pm z^{\star} \times \text{SE}.$$

* In a confidence interval, $z^{\star} \times \text{SE}$ is called the **margin of error**, and for a given sample, the margin of error changes as the confidence level changes.
* In order to change the confidence level we need to adjust $z^{\star}$ in the above formula.
* Commonly used confidence levels in practice are 90%, 95%, 98%, and 99%.
* For a 95% confidence interval, $z^{\star} = 1.96$.
* However, using the standard normal distribution, it is possible to find the appropriate $z^{\star}$ for any confidence level.

## 95% Confidence Interval

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center',fig.width=7,fig.height=3,out.width='80%'}
# normal pdf
mu <- 0
sigma <- 1
x_norm <- seq(-4,4,0.10)
norm_pdf <- dnorm(x_norm,mu,sigma)

# convert pdf into tibble
df_norm <- tibble(z=x_norm, norm_pdf=norm_pdf)

# plot the Bernoulli distribution and store it into a R variable
p1 <- ggplot(df_norm,aes(x=z,y=norm_pdf)) + 
  geom_line(color="#009159",linewidth=1) + 
  geom_ribbon(data=subset(df_norm,z>=-1.96 & z<=1.96),aes(x=z,ymax=dnorm(z,mu,sigma)),ymin=0,alpha=0.3,fill="#009159") +
  ylab("density") + 
  ylab("density") + 
  ggtitle("0.95 Probability is Between -1.96 to 1.96") + # sets the title of the plot
  scale_x_discrete(limits=c(-1.96,0,1.96)) + 
  theme_minimal() + # set theme of entire plot
  theme(legend.title=element_blank())

# display plot
p1
```

## Example 1

Which of the below Z scores is the appropriate $z^{\star}$ when calculating a 99.7% confidence interval?

(a) Z = 2.05
(b) Z = 2.33
(c) Z = 2.97
(d) Z = 1.96

::: {style="color: red;"}
$\star$ Estimating the $z^{\star}$ can be done using the 68-95-99.7 rule. We know that $P(-3 \le Z \le 3) \approx 0.997$. So, the closest answer is $Z = 2.97$.

## Example 1: 99.7% Confidence Interval

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center',fig.width=7,fig.height=3,out.width='80%'}
# normal pdf
mu <- 0
sigma <- 1
x_norm <- seq(-4,4,0.10)
norm_pdf <- dnorm(x_norm,mu,sigma)

# convert pdf into tibble
df_norm <- tibble(z=x_norm, norm_pdf=norm_pdf)

# plot the Bernoulli distribution and store it into a R variable
p1 <- ggplot(df_norm,aes(x=z,y=norm_pdf)) + 
  geom_line(color="#009159",linewidth=1) + 
  geom_ribbon(data=subset(df_norm,z>=-2.97 & z<=2.97),aes(x=z,ymax=dnorm(z,mu,sigma)),ymin=0,alpha=0.3,fill="#009159") +
  ylab("density") + 
  ylab("density") + 
  ggtitle("0.997 Probability is Between -2.97 to 2.97") + # sets the title of the plot
  scale_x_discrete(limits=c(-2.97,0,2.97)) + 
  theme_minimal() + # set theme of entire plot
  theme(legend.title=element_blank())

# display plot
p1
```
